<h1>MY ALL TIME FAVIOURITES</h1>
<h2>My Top three all time favourite movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>AVENGERS ENDGAME</h3>
<p>
  What can i say about this movie...it needs no introduction.One of the greatest
  of all times.This movie is my most faviourite as it contains all the things
  there should be in a movie all the faviorite superheroes finally coming
  together and having a great conclusion to their stories.The vfx,the
  throwbacks,everything.All is perfect in this movie. If u haven't watched it
  yet i would suggest you to watch it.

<h3>3 IDIOTS</h3>
<p>
  If u aren't a bollywood fan you should definitely watch this as it will surely
  make you a fan.This movie is regarding three students who graduates from an
  engineering college despite their family issues and problems in life.i would
  recommend wartching this if u are a college student.

<h3>MS DHONI:THE UNTOLD STORY</h3>
<p>
  This is a biopic of an indian cricketer MS DHONI.his role is played by Sushant
  Sing Rajput,who definately has done a great job in doing so. The dialogues,the
  roleplay,the acting.Every thing is on point. I would recommend it if you are a
  cricket fan.
